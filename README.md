# Online-Sales-Prediction

An Exploratory Data Analysis and Prediction, on a dataset with Online Product Sales from different categories and continents.
First I explore, clean and impute the data.
Afterwards, I Visaulize the Categorical and the Numerical values.
When I have finally understand my data, I will begin splitting it unto training and testing sets.
I will be trying to predict the Total Revenue.
I will use 5 models from the scikit-learn framework and a neural network from the tensorflow frameowrk.
The 5 models will be: Linear Regression, Support Vector Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor,
Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor.
I visualize and calculate the evaluations and results.
